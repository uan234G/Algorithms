Algorithms in JavaScript

Big O:
"To assist in the calculus of runtime complexities, we approximate the scalability of an algorithm by extrapolating its input sizes toward infinity before counting the number of operations required. At this worst-case runtime upper bound, we can drop coefficients and additive terms, retaining only factors that dominate the function. Consequently, just a few categories can describe the scalability of almost any algorithm.
The most optimum algorithm scales in constant time and space. This means it does not care at all about the growth of its inputs. Next best is logarithmic time or space, then linear, linearithmic, quadratic, and exponential. The worst is factorial time or space. In Big-O notation:"

    Constant: O(1)
    Logarithmic: O(log n)
    Linear: O(n)
    Linearithmic: O(n log n)
    Quadratic: O(nÂ²)
    Expontential: O(2^n)
    Factorial: O(n!)
