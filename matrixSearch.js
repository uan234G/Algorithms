/*
  Matrix Search
  Mike digs image recognition and wants to create a JavaScript Imaging Library, just like PIL for Python. He is given 2 different two-dimensional arrays, containing integers between 0 and 65535. Each two-dimensional array represents a gray-scale image, where each integer value is a pixel. The second image might be found somewhere within the larger one. Return whether it is.
  Given array: [[12,34,45,56], and array: [[67,78], return true . [98,87,76,65],[43,32] ] [56, 67 , 78 ,89] , [54, 43 , 32 ,21] ]
  Second: Return location of first match found ( [-1,-1] if no match). In example above, return [2,1] .
